    <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder
            in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup
            of marinade for basting.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add salmon steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out
            excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Broil salmon steaks under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes, brushing salmon with reserved marinade. Turn
            and continue to broil until salmon is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush with marinade.
